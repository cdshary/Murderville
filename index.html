    <p>What is murder? Murder is defined by Merriam-Webster as the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought.  </p>
    <p>Our team of data scientists have combed through thousands of rows of data to bring you the most interactive and comprehseive visualizations on the web. </p>
    <p>In order to get the data we needed to create our visualizations, we focused on accessing a murder database created by the FBI complete with murders from all 50 states from years 2000-2014 even down to the city. We also gathered population data from Census.gov to get the most accurate counts of murders per 100,000, as well as education and income levels down to the county. Combined, you will be able to formulate you own conclusions.... Will you be next?</p>
