    <h1 class="layer1">USA's Most Deadliest State: California </h1></center>
    <p></p>
    <center><img src="plot1.png"></center><p>"You haven't lived until you've died in California." - Mort Sahl, American comedian</p>
  Our team of data scientist combed through thousands of rows of FBI data on murders throughout the country to find the state with the highest total murders. Eureka! Little did we know, the Goldenstate was darker than we thought. California, the land of milk and honey, far exceeds the total murders in each state combined when compared against the entire USA.  
  </p>
  According to our visual, 2005 was a bad year for those living above the ground unless you had invested in funeral home stocks. We can't explain the peak in California murders that year, but we do know these events did occur during that timeframe - which may or may not have angered some residents:
   <ul>&#8226 Hillary Swank and Jamie Foxx won an Acadmey Award for "Million Dollar Baby"</ul>
   <ul>&#8226 "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" premieres on the Disney Channel, starring Dylan and Cole Sprouse</ul>
   <ul>&#8226 US version of "The Office" premiers on NBC</ul>
   <ul>&#8226 Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger elected Pope Benedict XVI </ul>
   <ul>&#8226 The United States Supreme Court votes to ban medical marijuana in Gonzales v. Raich</ul>
   <ul>&#8226 A jury in Santa Maria, California acquits pop singer Michael Jackson of molesting 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo at his Neverland Ranch</ul>
   <ul>&#8226 "Wedding Crashers", starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, premieres</ul>
   <ul>&#8226 The Boston Bruins trade captain Joe Thornton to the San Jose Sharks</ul>

  What does this graph show other than a regularly booming mortuary industry in California? The timeframe depicted shows a decrease in the murder rate in California towards 2014. We can only hope that this declination will continue as we get ready to gather the next set of data for the years thereafter.
