    <h1 class="layer1">Welcome to Murderville USA</h1></center>
    <p>Our team of data scientists worked hard to bring you comprehensive data visualizations depicting murders that took place all across the USA from 2000 to 2014. However, our intention wasn't always so. In light of upcoming Valentine's Day, we first 
        wanted to create a project that pulled data off of trending dating apps like Tinder. A quick API search showed us that data from romantic social apps was extremely hard to obtain. Basically, all of the data was locked down to members of the public. 
    Our next best choice was to find out what our chances are of becoming a serial killer victim based on our age, gender, location, income and education level. Did any of these elements mean anything when compared to murder data? Could we draw some meaning when looking at varying levels of the data combined?
  </p><p>
      Just how common is murder? Even if we took away income and education data, just how many murders do we see in specific geographic locations per 100,000 people? We had lots of questions and subsequently data to comb through. We hope that you will enjoy
    browsing our site as much as we had fun working together to bring you the best visualizations on the web. 
    
    Feel free to click on the Sunburst Visual on the top navigation bar to see an interactive pie chart at work depicting the perpetrator's preferred method of murder. In the same visualization, feel free to play around with the varying levels of the chart to uncover information about the victims and the most common relationship to the murderer.<p>

    Please also check out the Murder Map which is a complex and interactive map showing you murders in nearly every city and county across the US from 2000 to 2014. Utilize the markers to make your own visual correlation
    between murders in a location with information showing the high school graduation rate and median income for reference. Do you see a pattern? Is it a coincidence or is there something more to the data? Can you find where you live on the map? What do you see? We're all <b>dying</b> to know.</p>
    </p>
   <p>Lastly, please poke around at our drop-down menu above which hosts resources and actual data for your viewing pleasure. The data in particular is extremely resourceful. We meticulously cleaned the data and matched key identifiers that we needed to create the visualizations listed above. </p>
    <p>Happy Browsing!</p></p>
